# Pixel Pursuit

Project 1 of Ironhack, Week 3


## Description

For the first project, we needed to render a game in the browser.
And he should have logic for winning and/or losing and show feedback to the player in either case.


## Challenge

- I had to start all over again on Wednesday except for the grid, because I keep thinking about new features and it got too complicated.
- Didn't have time to style the game!
- For this project I was not use to read and understand errors in the console, but it trained me.


## Possible Improvement

- The overall style.
- Begin the project only when everything is planned.
- Create some difficulty levels (more easy for beggining and improve after)
