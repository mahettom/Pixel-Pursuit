# Pixel Pursuit

Project 1 of Ironhack, Week 3 !

> Github page is available feel free to try it !


## Description

For the first project, we needed to render a game in the browser.
And he should have logic for winning and/or losing and show feedback to the player in either case.


## Challenge

- I had to start all over again on Wednesday except for the grid, because I keep thinking about new features and it got too complicated.
- Time management, didn't have time to style the game! 
- Keeping track of all the class and their relationships together.
- For this project I was not use to read and understand errors in the console, but it trained me.
- Keep the code clean with a lot of classes.



## Possible Improvement

- The overall style.
- Begin the project only when everything is planned.
- Create some difficulty levels (more easy for beggining and improve after).
- Make more comment for describe each step.
