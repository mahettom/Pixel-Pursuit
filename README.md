## Description

Project 1              Week 3

For the first project, we needed to render a game in the browser.
And he should have logic for winning and/or losing and show feedback to the player in either case.

## Challenge

- I had to start all over again on Wednesday except for the grid, because I keep thinking about new features and it got too complicated.
- For this project I was not use to read and understand errors in the console, but it trained me.
